Nemesis is a hybrid [ROS1/ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) skid-steer UVG which grew out of an effort primarily to familiarize my self with integrating an exising ground vehicle into the ROS ecosystem.

![Nemesis Main]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/nemesis-main-min.jpg)

{% include gallery caption="" %}

The project began with the implementation a C++ ROS1 `hardware_interface` for the [Monsterborg mobile base][monsterborg-base-site] from PiBorg.  

On its completion I went on to extend the system with a i7 processor and sensors payload for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Since then I have been using the system as an outdoor mapping and a mobile compute edge platform for drone navigation experiments including the [TUM AR Drone ROS stack][tum-ar-drone-ros-wiki].

Very recently, I have began to make inroads into adding experimental autonomous navigation support with the ROS1 [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base#:~:text=The%20move_base%20package%20provides%20an,accomplish%20its%20global%20navigation%20task.) package. After a rudimentary setup of `move_base` on ROS Melodic, I decided to switch to ROS2 Foxy to leveradge the `nav2` package for greater flexibility using `ros1_bridge` to communicate with the mobile base Kinetic stack.  This is currently current work in progress.

The following describes my stable setup on ROS1.

## System Architecture

![Nemesis system architecture diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/nemesis_arch.jpg)

The System architecture is logically into two system components with corresponding code repositories:

1.  A mobile base with an internal ARM based (ARM Cortex-A53 1.2GHz) base controller computer running ROS Kinetic.
[antoan/nemesis][nemesis]

2.  Upper chassis housing an i7 Intel dual core processor (i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz) computer running 'ROS Melodic' and Intel Realsense [D435i](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/) depth & [T256](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/) tracking cameras, positioned relative to each other with a dedicated mount. 
[antoan/nemesis_core][nemesis-core] 

Both computers are connected via ethernet network with an onboard router. The robot can be driven via multiplexed input from a Sony PS4 DualShock 4 controller, ROS `rqt_steering` plugin or `cmd_vel` input from `move_base`.

## Software Architecture

The software stack running on the mobile base is largely based on an adaptation of the [Clearpath Husky Kinetic][husky-kinetic-github-branch] stack's base, control, description and navigation packages. 

The ROS hardware interface implementation wraps the motor controller driver that came with the mobile base, which I ported to Cython from Python, to reduce latency in the main ROS control loop.  
For perception and SLAM, I use [rtabmap_ros][rtabmap-ros-wiki] built from source with Apriltag support. In addition, I use the  [realsense_ros][realsense-ros-github] with the Realsense distribution installation method rather than the `ros-melodic-realsense-ros` package.
